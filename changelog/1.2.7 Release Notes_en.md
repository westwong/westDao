# WestDao Core Library - Version 1.2.7 Release Notes

## Wise Execution Simple Tools

[中文版](https://github.com/westwong/westDao/blob/master/changelog/1.2.7%20Release%20Notes.md)

### Improvements

- For WestDao entities, static and final attributes are now ignored during overrides.

- Compatibility issue resolved where omitting `@Accessors(chain = true)` would result in errors; however, its usage is still recommended.

  ```java
  @Entity
  @Data
  @Accessors(chain = true)
  @WestDao
  public class User implements Serializable {
  }
  ```

- Version dependencies have been adjusted.

### Bug Fixes

- Enhanced support for boolean types in entities. Boolean getter methods in various frameworks often start with "is" (although it's recommended to use wrapper types for database entity objects).

### Others

- **Documentation Updates**: Updated project documentation to reflect new features and improvements.
