# WestDao Core Library - Version 1.2.6 Release Notes

## Wise Execution Simple Tools

[中文版](https://github.com/westwong/westDao/blob/master/changelog/1.2.6%20Release%20Notes.md)

### New Features

- **Added Parent Entity Constructor for WestDao Entities**: It's now possible to directly instantiate WestDao using the parent class.

  ```java
   	@RequestMapping("/v3/user/find")
      public Result<Object> findByIdV3(User user) {
          Assert.notNull(user.getId(), "id is required");
          User db = new WestUser(user).findById();
          return Result.successResult(db);
      }
  ```

### Improvements

- Urgently replaced all package names to "cn.k2future" due to a lost domain name.

### Bug Fixes

- Enhanced support for boolean types in entities. Boolean getter methods in various frameworks often start with "is" (although it's recommended to use wrapper types for database entity objects).

### Others

- **Documentation Updates**: Updated project documentation to reflect new features and improvements.
- **Test Cases**: Added new test cases to cover enhanced query functionality and ensure robust performance.
