# WestDao Core Library - Version 1.2.5 Release Notes

## Wise Execution Simple Tools

[中文版](https://github.com/westwong/westDao/blob/master/changelog/1.2.5%20Release%20Notes.md)

### New Features

- **Added Dynamic JPQL Execution Capability**: You can now use JPQL directly for database access.

  ```java
  @RequestMapping("/v2/user/update")
  @Transactional
  public Result<Object> updateToPramsV2(User user) {
      int execute = West.updateJPQL(user).eq(User::getId, 20L).execute();
      return Result.successResult(execute);
  }
  ```

  - Added execute() method for UpdateJPQL and DeleteJPQL.
  - Added getEntity(), listEntity(), pageEntity(), count(), getMap(), listMap(), and pageMap() methods for queryJPQL.
  - Dynamic JPQL now supports alias setting with setEntityAlias(), and also provides getEntityAlias() and getEntityName() methods.

- **Enhanced Query Support**: Added support for complex query conditions, including `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, and `LIMIT` clauses.

  ```java
  @RequestMapping("/v2/user/list")
  public Result<Object> listV2() {
      List<User> orderBY = West.<User>queryJPQL()
              .orderByDesc(User::getAge)
              .orderByAsc(User::getId)
              .limit(10)
              .listEntity();
      List<Map<String, Object>> group = West.<User>queryJPQL()
              // If age is not given an alias, it will default to 'colnum0'
              .select("age as age, count(1) as num")
              .groupBy(User::getAge)
              .having("age > 10")
              .orderByAsc(User::getAge)
              .listMap();
      Map<String, Object> result = new HashMap<>(4);
      result.put("orderBY", orderBY);
      result.put("group", group);
      return Result.successResult(result);
  }
  ```

  - Added support for select strings.
  - Added support for alias query field parsing.
  - Added support for multiple order by clauses.
  - Added support for group by clauses.
  - Added support for limit clauses.

### Improvements

- Adjusted some code structures to improve readability.
- Optimized object lifecycle to enhance performance.
- Renamed method calls in the West utility package to West.updateJPQL(), West.deleteJPQL(), West.queryJPQL(), and added support for method generics (West.<User>queryJPQL()).

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed some known bugs.
- Marked the issue where JPQL parsing `or()` in JPA framework results in missing parentheses in SQL, though it is not yet resolved. Please be cautious when using it.

### Others

- **Documentation Updates**: Updated project documentation to reflect new features and improvements.
- **Test Cases**: Added new test cases to cover enhanced query functionality and ensure robust performance.
